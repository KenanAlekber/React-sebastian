                <h3>My Career So Far</h3>

                <span>Always up for a challenge, I have worked for lean start-ups and was a member of the first
                    New Zealand start-up to attend Y Combinator, the largest start-up accelerator in the world.
                    From there, I worked my way up to Art Director and Team Lead at Appster where I oversaw the
                    design of 30+ mobile and desktop apps. Currently I am a Senior Product Designer at Linktree
                    leading design for the Linktree mobile app</span>
